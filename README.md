# lc3vm-java
This is a Java Gui Based implementation of LC-3 VM

It is an EXACT copy of the C-code by J. Meiners and R. Pendleton taken from their site: Write your Own Virtual Machine 
https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/

Except the c code was converted to Java to simulate a gui based version of it.

Other notes:
Test with Java 8 Windows 10 (64 bit).

Status: Not completely working as of Feb 07 2020.

To run, simply edit the bat file and update the IMAGE_FOLDER string variable in tiny.vm.CPU.java file so that it point to 2048.obj image which is loaded into the VM.
