# lc3vm-java
This is a Java Gui Based implementation of LC-3 VM

It is an EXACT copy of the C-code by J. Meiners and R. Pendleton taken from their site: Write your Own Virtual Machine 
https://justinmeiners.github.io/lc3-vm/

Except the c code was converted to Java to simulate a gui based version of it.

Other notes:
Test with Java 8 on Windows 10 (64 bit). You will need Java 7 or 8, Ant 1.9+ or Exlipse for Java.

Status: See issues.
